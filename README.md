# online_exam_system_asp
 An attempt to implement a system where students can attend their MCQ test on an online (ASP) platform and will be able to view their performance/result immediately. The platform is supported by SQL Server as a storage back-end. 
[I was assigned the task to create modules of the project where the students were able to view their scheduled examinations, were able to attend the examination according to their schedule and view their result immediately after attempting the said exam]
